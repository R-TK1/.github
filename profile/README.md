The organization contains several projects, all of which are components of the wider RPGtk toolset. The GUI editor is included under [`editor`](), while the actual engine is under [`engine`](https://github.com/RPGtk/tk-engine). All other repositories contain items such as [windowing abstractions](https://github.com/RPGtk/tk-window), [graphical helpers](https://github.com/RPGtk/tk-vulkan), and other engine-related components.
